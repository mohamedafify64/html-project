<h1>concept of programming language</h1>
Before we get to it, let’s discuss some differences in programming languages: they can range from high-level to low level (low meaning syntax friendlier for the machines and high meaning friendlier for humans).
There are also different programming paradigms – or the types of logic that are being used. The most popular categories that you will hear about are object-oriented programming and functional programming. There isn’t a better one or a worse one – and you will find people who are fans of one or the other – or people who use both and like both. They’re simply different types of logic! 
I won’t go into too much detail there because this video isn’t about that (and there are plenty of resources that will explain this concept to you), but functional is the linear mathematical logic that we are used to in school and object-oriented groups things in objects that can later be altered.
It’s good to keep in mind the different logic types when starting a different language, so I’ll mention the logic type in ever language description. Let’s get to it!

<h2>What was the first programming language?</h2>
It’s generally accepted that Ada Lovelace’s “Algorithm for the Analytical Engine” is the first computer language ever created. Its purpose was to help Charles Baggage with Bernoulli number computations and Ada designed it in 1883. Lovelace describes her machine as different from previous calculating machines because of its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity. Her contributions to the computer programming world are important because it showed the capabilites of computed devices almost 100 years before the thought of a modern programming computer was realized.
