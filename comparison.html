    <td>C may be older than you: it was released in 1972! So at the date of writing this, it’s 47 years old. It is probably one of the most widely-used languages in tech right now. 

It is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications – meaning that it’s widely used for developing device drivers.

It’s pretty powerful and was the inspiration for many advanced programming languages, including C++, Java C#, JavaScript and Pearl.

It is used to develop systems applications that are integrated into operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux, as well as embedded software. Systems Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Industrial Automation, Computer Graphics, Space Research, Image Processing and Game Programming.

Major organizations that use C are Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, Cisco, Raytheon.</td>
    <td>C++ is an object-oriented, middle-level programming language. It was created to be an extension of the C programming language that provides a higher-level of abstraction but is still powerful and efficient.

It’s a general-purpose programming language that is used a lot to work with System/Application Software, Drivers, Client-Server Applications and Embedded Firmware.

Major companies that use C++ are Google, Mozilla, Winamp, Adobe, Amazon, Lockheed Martin.

Fun fact: the main cafe at the Google office in London where I worked was called C++!</td>
    <td>C# is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means it supports multiple programming paradigms or types of logic. 

It was developed in the 2000s by Microsoft within its .NET initiative – and was based on C, C++ and Java languages. As a result, it’s very similar to those languages and is widely used for developing Windows desktop applications and games. It can be used for almost anything though, including gaming, web applications and is becoming increasingly popular for mobile development too.

It is widely used in IT, Engineering, Design, Professional Services, Management and Quality Control.

Major organizations that use C# are Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett Packard.</td>
