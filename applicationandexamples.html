<h1>Programming Languages and Their Uses</h1>
<h3>1. Python</h3>
Probably one of the easiest languages out there to start with for beginners because of how user-friendly its syntax is, how widely it’s used and what a big community it has around it. It’s my favourite programming language, and I have a video about it with a neat breakdown into details.

Python is a high-level, object-oriented language and can be used for data mining and visualisation, machine learning, web applications, game development and honestly anything else you can think of — yes, it’s that versatile!

Some of the major organizations and companies that use Python are Google, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, DropBox, NASA.
<h3>2. Java</h3>
Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world right now! It isn’t as beginner-friendly as Python, as it was designed to feel similar to C++ but simpler to use.

Java is also a high-level, object-oriented language. One of its main draws is that it’s very powerful and secure and so all of the banking application development happens in Java only. It’s perfect for someone looking to work in Android development, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, or game/desktop app development.

A lot of people, including my fellow blonde techie YouTuber Blondiebytes, recommend learning this language as your first programming language because it reveals a lot of things that are behind the scenes in other languages!

Major organizations that use Java are Airbnb, Uber, eBay, Pinterest, Groupon, Spotify, Pandora.
<h3>3. JavaScript</h3>
JavaScript is a client-side programming language, meaning that it works in the user’s browser – as opposed to interacting with a server. It’s a high-level, prototype-based object-oriented programming language. It’s mostly used for front-end development. Don’t confuse JavaScript with Java though – they’re very different! 

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web and in fact, you’re interacting with it right now by interacting with this page. And most likely on the website, you visited before. And the one you will go to next.

It is traditionally paired with HTML & CSS and is a front-end language used to create interactive websites, but thanks to recent technologies like Node.js, it is possible to use JavaScript as a backend language! Needless to say, JavaScript is very popular and is the language of choice for many, many developers.

Major organizations that use JavaScript are WordPress, Soundcloud, Khan Academy, Linkedin, Groupon, Yahoo and many others.

<h3>4. Ruby</h3>
Ruby is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. It’s also very beginner-friendly and you can start building things fairly quickly with the framework called Rails (this is where the expression Ruby on Rails comes from). It’s used for web app development, robotics, networking, system administration and security. It is great for simulations and is even used for those by NASA!

Some of the major organizations that use it are Github, Scribd, Groupon, NASA Langley Research Center, Motorola, Google (SketchUp). Basecamp, Amazon, Twitter and Groupon were all created using Ruby on Rails.

Ruby’s founder, Yukihiro Matsumoto, intended it to be “simple in appearance, but it is very complex inside, just like our human body.”

Funnily enough, this was the language that I’ve initially started with!
<h3>5. PHP</h3>
PHP is a multi-paradigm programming language, designed for creating dynamic web pages that effectively work with databases. It is a general-purpose language and is widely used for Web Application Development, Server-Side Scripting, Command Line Scripting.

Fun fact is that PHP wasn’t intentionally created as a programming language – it’s founder, Rasmus Lerdorf, initially wrote several programs in C, that were supposed to help him maintain his personal homepage. These programs worked with webforms and databases and could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. He wasn’t trying to design a programming language (in fact he didn’t know how to), but he kept on adding functionality to the program and ended up with one! 

The newest versions of PHP have been rewritten, so you can’t see the same inconsistency that existed in the first organic version, but still, that’s pretty fun! 

Major organizations that use PHP are Facebook, Yahoo, CyberCoders, NextGen.
<h3>6. Swift</h3>
Swift is Apple’s general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language for iOS and OS X apps. It was created to preserve the main concepts of Objective-C (the other programming language you can use for iOS development), but to also catch bugs in a more eloquent way.

If you’re building a native app for an iPhone, Swift will most likely be your language of choice!

Major companies that use Swift are Apple, Getty Images, Slack, Dow Jones, Playlist Media.
